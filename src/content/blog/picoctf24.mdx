  Using a Secure Shell (SSH) is going to be pretty important. \
  Can you `ssh` as `ctf-player` to `titan.picoctf.net` at port `55352` to get the flag? \
  You'll also need the password `83dcefb7`. If asked, accept the fingerprint with `yes`. \
  If your device doesn't have a shell, you can use: https://webshell.picoctf.org \
  If you're not sure what a shell is, check out our Primer: https://primer.picoctf.com/#_the_shell
</Pico>
We can use a simple `ssh` command to connect to the server:

```bash
$ ssh ctf-player@titan.picoctf.net -p55352

  I accidentally wrote the flag down. Good thing I deleted it! \
  You download the challenge files here:

Unzipping the challenge file shows us a directory with a `.git` subdirectory:

We can see that there is a `message.txt`, and multiple objects referenced in the `.git/objects` directory. `message.txt`'s contents aren't useful:

```bash
$ bat message.txt -p
TOP SECRET
```

Let's check `git log` to see what's happening:

```bash
$ git log

```

We can checkout the first commit and then get the flag:

```bash
$ git checkout 6603cb4ff0c4ea293798c03a32e0d78d5ab12ca2
Note: switching to '6603cb4ff0c4ea293798c03a32e0d78d5ab12ca2'.

  What was I last working on? I remember writing a note to help me remember... \
  You can download the challenge files here:
  * [challenge.zip](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c_titan/162/challenge.zip)
</Pico>

Once again, the zip has a `message.txt` and a `.git` directory:

```bash
$ unzip challenge.zip
Archive:  challenge.zip
   creating: drop-in/
  inflating: drop-in/message.txt
   creating: drop-in/.git/
<...>
$ cd drop-in
$ bat message.txt -p
This is what I was working on, but I'd need to look at my commit history to know why...
```

Based on the message, we know we need to use `git log`:

```bash
$ git log

  Someone's commits seems to be preventing the program from working. Who is it?
  You can download the challenge files here:
  * [challenge.zip](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c_titan/159/challenge.zip)

This time instead of a `message.txt`, we get a `message.py`:

```bash
$ unzip challenge.zip
Archive:  challenge.zip
   creating: drop-in/
 extracting: drop-in/message.py
   creating: drop-in/.git/
<...>
$ cd drop-in
$ bat -p message.py

  My team has been working very hard on new features for our flag printing program! I wonder how they'll work together? \
  You can download the challenge files here:

This time, there are multiple branches:

```bash
$ unzip challenge.zip

   creating: drop-in/.git/refs/

  inflating: drop-in/.git/logs/refs/heads/feature/part-3
  inflating: drop-in/flag.py
$ cd drop-in
$ bat -p flag.py
print("Printing the flag...")
```

Let's check the contents of `flag.py` in each of the branches:

```bash
$ git show feature/part-{1..3}:flag.py
print("Printing the flag...")
print("picoCTF{t3@mw0rk_", end='')print("Printing the flag...")

print("m@k3s_th3_dr3@m_", end='')print("Printing the flag...")

print("w0rk_6c06cec1}")
```

Combining the flag strings, we get `picoCTF{t3@mw0rk_m@k3s_th3_dr3@m_w0rk_6c06cec1}`.

    1. Have you ever played hot or cold? Binary search is a bit like that.
    2. You have a very limited number of guesses. Try larger jumps between numbers!
    3. The program will randomly choose a new number each time you connect. You can always try again, but you should start your binary search over from the beginning - try around 500. Can you think of why?

  Want to play a game? As you use more of the shell, you might be interested in how they work! Binary search is a classic algorithm used to quickly find an item in a sorted list. Can you find the flag? You'll have 1000 possibilities and only 10 guesses. \
  Cyber security often has a huge amount of data to look through - from logs, vulnerability reports, and forensics. Practicing the fundamentals manually might help you in the future when you have to write your own tools! \
  You can download the challenge files here:

Again, we can just play the game with the help of cyberchef:
![using cyberchef to get little endian representation](https://i.sportshead.dev/rm7qy29.png)

```bash
$ nc titan.picoctf.net 62401
Welcome to the Endian CTF!
You need to find both the little endian and big endian representations of a word.
If you get both correct, you will receive the flag.
Word: netnd
Enter the Little Endian representation: 646e74656e
Correct Little Endian representation!
Enter the Big Endian representation: 6e65746e64
Correct Big Endian representation!
Congratulations! You found both endian representations correctly!

  Can you abuse the banner? \
  The server has been leaking some crucial information on `tethys.picoctf.net 59710`. Use the leaked information to get to the server. \
  To connect to the running application use `nc tethys.picoctf.net 50678`. From the above information abuse the machine and find the flag in the /root directory.
</Pico>

Let's see what information is being leaked:

```bash
$ nc tethys.picoctf.net 59710
SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_7.6p1 My_Passw@rd_@1234
```

Seems like the SSH server header and a password. Let's connect to the application:

```bash
$ nc tethys.picoctf.net 50678
*************************************

*************************************

what is the password?
My_Passw@rd_@1234

```

After quickly googling for the first phreaker, we can get a shell on the server. Let's see what we can find:

```bash
player@challenge:~$ cat banner
cat banner

Seems like we're meant to read `/root/flag.txt`. Unfortunately, only root has permission to read it. Let's see if there's anything interesting in `script.py`:

```python

cat script.py

The program opens `/home/player/banner` and outputs it at the start. Based on the hint, we know that we are meant to use symlinks. If we can change `/home/player/banner` to be a symlink, we can point it to `/root/flag.txt` and cause the program to read it for us.

```bash
player@challenge:/proc$ cd ~
cd ~
player@challenge:~$ ls -l

And now if we connect to the server again:

```bash
$ nc tethys.picoctf.net 50678
picoCTF{b4nn3r_gr4bb1n9_su((3sfu11y_68ca8b23}

what is the password?

  The Multiverse is within your grasp! Unfortunately, the server that contains the secrets of the multiverse is in a universe where keyboards only have numbers and (most) symbols. \

Connecting to the server puts us into a bash jail, with all letters being blocked:

```bash
SansAlpha$ a
SansAlpha: Unknown character detected
SansAlpha$ A
SansAlpha: Unknown character detected
SansAlpha$ ""
bash: : command not found
```

Let's see what files are in the current directory:

```bash
SansAlpha$ **
bash: blargh: command not found

SansAlpha$ **/*
bash: blargh/flag.txt: Permission denied
```

Seems like we will need to read `blargh/flag.txt` somehow. But how can we use `cat` without using the letters `c`, `a`, and `t`? A quick google search brings us to a page called [launch bash without using any letters](https://www.commandlinefu.com/commands/view/11704/launch-bash-without-using-any-letters). The second answer uses a redirection of a bash "command not found" error message to stdout, then using brace expressions to extract the `bash` string from the start.
Using this method, we can get a bunch of letters into a variable:

```bash
SansAlpha$ _1="$(- 2>&1)"
bash: warning: setlocale: LC_ALL: cannot change locale (en_US.UTF-8)

SansAlpha$ "$_1"
bash: bash: -: command not found: command not found
```

Now that we have `bash: -: command not found: command not found`, we have enough letters to use `cat`. We can use ["Substring Expansion"](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Shell-Parameter-Expansion.html) in order to extract each letter that we need, in the form `${parameter:offset:length}`.

Here are the characters we need:

- `c` at position 9
- `a` at position 1
- `t` at position 19

Putting it together:

```bash
SansAlpha$ _2="${_1:9:1}${_1:1:1}${_1:19:1}"
SansAlpha$ $_2 **/*
return 0 picoCTF{7h15_mu171v3r53_15_m4dn355_36a674c0}Alpha-9, a distinctive layer within the Calastran multiverse, stands as a
sanctuary realm offering individuals a rare opportunity for rebirth and
introspection. Positioned as a serene refuge between the higher and lower
Layers, Alpha-9 serves as a cosmic haven where beings can start anew,
unburdened by the complexities of their past lives. The realm is characterized
by ethereal landscapes and soothing energies that facilitate healing and
self-discovery. Quantum Resonance Wells, unique to Alpha-9, act as conduits for
individuals to reflect on their past experiences from a safe and contemplative
distance. Here, time flows differently, providing a respite for those seeking
solace and renewal. Residents of Alpha-9 find themselves surrounded by an
atmosphere of rejuvenation, encouraging personal growth and the exploration of
untapped potential. While the layer offers a haven for introspection, it is not
without its challenges, as individuals must confront their past and navigate
the delicate equilibrium between redemption and self-acceptance within this
tranquil cosmic retreat.

And this is proof that any device is good enough for CTFs:

## Conclusion

Overall, this year's General Skills challenges were very underwhelming. The only one that I enjoyed was SansAlpha, which taught me how to use bash error strings to construct commands.
I felt that this category was acting like a git tutorial this year and I would loved to have see some more creative and interesting challenges. I also felt that a lot of the challenges
in this category suffered from point inflation, and did not accurately reflect the difficulty of these challenges.
